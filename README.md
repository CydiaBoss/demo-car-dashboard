# Car Dashboard Demo

This is an example build of a full-stack build of a car's dashboard.
It uses VueJS for the frontend and ExpressJS for the backend.
They were chosen for their simplicity which matches perfectly with this demo.

For more information on each part of the stack, refer to the `README.md` in each directory.
